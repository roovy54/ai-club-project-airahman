# Introduction

Music AI can be divided into two parts which is Analysis and Generation

## Music Analysis
- Music semantic labelling
    - genre
    - emotion
    - other attributes like slow/fast
- Music transcription (audio2score)
    - note
    - instrument 
    - meter
    - key

## Music Generation (score2audio)
- MIDI generation
- Audio generation
- MIDI-to-audio generation

Note: [Gaudiolab Source Separation Technology](https://www.gaudiolab.com/technology/source-separation) for music source separation

## Books and Notebooks on Music AI
- Fundmentals of Music Processing by Meinard Muller
- [FMP Jupyter Notebook](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C0/C0.html)
